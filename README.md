- **Location** (by latitude(43 to 44) and longitude(-78 to -79))
- **Event Description**
- **Event Type(Tag)**

#### **Technical Implementation**

- The `CreateEventInteractor` and `ModifyEventInteractor` classes are the core drivers of the event management feature. These classes handle **data validation**, **data storage**, and **event modification**.
- Events are stored using `FirebaseService` for reliability, ensuring data is always available in real-time.

#### **Screenshots**

## **FAQs and Troubleshooting** üõ†Ô∏è


### **FAQs**:


**Q: What should I do if I encounter an error during the registration process?**

- **A**: Ensure all form fields are correctly filled out (username, email, password). Check if the email format is valid and the username isn't already taken.


**Q: Why am I unable to see all events on the map?**  

- **A**: Ensure that you have **enabled all event filters**. By default, only certain types of events may be displayed based on your preferences. Check the filters on the sidebar and adjust the event filter.


**Q: Can I delete an event after I have created it?**  

- **A**: Yes, you can delete an event that you‚Äôve created. Go to **Modify Event**, select the **Delete Event** at the bottom, and click on it. 


**Q: Why am I not receiving email notifications?**  

- **A**: Check your email settings to ensure notifications are not being blocked. Additionally:
  - 1. Verify that your **email address** is correct in **Profile Settings**.
  - 2. Check your **spam folder**.


**Q: How do I update event information after it‚Äôs been created?**  

- **A**: If you are the event organizer, navigate to **Your Events** from the main menu. Click on **Modify Event** next to the event you wish to modify, make the necessary changes, and save them. The attendees will be notified of any updates automatically.



**Q: Can I use EventHiveUofT if I‚Äôm not affiliated with UofT?**  

- **A**: The platform is primarily built for the **University of Toronto** community, but non-affiliated users can still join **public events** if allowed by the event organizer. Please note that some features, like **creating events**, may be restricted to authenticated UofT users.


**Q: Why can't I find certain buildings on the interactive map?**  

- **A**: Ensure that the map is **fully loaded** and that you are zoomed in enough. Some smaller buildings or less significant landmarks may not be visible at a higher zoom level. The list of buildings includes major UofT locations such as **Robarts Library**, **Sidney Smith Hall**, and more.



### **Common Issues and Troubleshooting:**

**Issue: Firebase Connection Fails**

**Solution**:

- **Verify Service Account Path**: Ensure the `firebase-service-account.json` is correctly placed in the `/private/` directory and that its path matches the **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable.
- **Permission Checks**: Confirm that the credentials have the required permissions within the Firebase project to access **Firestore**, **Authentication**, and other used services.
- **Network Issues**: If you're behind a firewall or VPN, check that the required ports for Firebase are not blocked.

**Issue: Maven Build Errors**

**Solution**:

- **Run Clean Build**: Clear previous build artifacts by running:
  ```sh
  mvn clean install
  ```
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependency versions are compatible with each other by checking the `pom.xml` file.
- **JDK Issues**: Make sure you are using **Java 11** or higher, and that the Java environment variable (`JAVA_HOME`) points to the correct version.

---

**Issue: Map Pins Not Showing Up**

**Solution**:

- **Dependencies Set Up**: Verify that the project dependencies have been setted up and Maven has built the porject successfully.
- **Map Data Not Loaded**: Check the console logs for errors related to loading the **JXMapViewer** data. Make sure the data endpoints are properly connected.

---

**Issue: Unable to RSVP to Events**

**Solution**:

- **Login Check**: Make sure you are logged in before attempting to RSVP to an event.
- **Event Capacity**: Verify that the event isn‚Äôt at full capacity. The RSVP function will not allow users to join if the event has reached its limit.
- **Network Stability**: Ensure your network connection is stable, as RSVP actions require an active connection to Firebase.
